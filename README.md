# task-list
For our final project with Generation USA
<br>

## Description
<hr>
A responsive and dynamic tool to make organizing daily activities easier and more convenient. In this to-do list website, give your task a title, a due date, an assignee, and describe it. Each task appears below the form and has the option to mark the task as complete and/or delete the task. The ocean water background is a kind reminder that there's more to life than our daily tasks.

## Technologies Used
